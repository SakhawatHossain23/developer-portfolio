            <p>
                I recently completed my undergraduate degree in computer science and
                technology. Now, I am focusing on my postgraduate part for further study. In
                the meantime, I'm trying to gain some experience in computer science and
                technology by working with some professionals.I completed my internship
                under two professional and very well known IT companies called TELLHOW and
                HIKVISION. There I learned many new things about computer science and
                technology and also had a very healthy environment to practice my academic
                knowledge. Now, I'm more interested in learning about new technological
                innovations and uses.

            <p>
                A Dream is a succession of images,ideas,emotions,and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the
                maind during certain stages of sleep.The content and purpose of Dream are not fully understood,although
                they have been a topic of scientific,philosopical and religious interest throughout recorded history.
                Dream interpreration is the attempt at drawing meaning from dream and searching for anunderlaying
                message. The scientific study of dream is called oneirology. Dream mainly occour in the rapid eye
                movement stage of sleep -when brain activity is hihgh and resembles that of being awake. REM sleep is
                revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep. At times ,dream may occor during other steps
                of sleep. However , these drems tend to be much less vivid or memorable.
